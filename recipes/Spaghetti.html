        <h2> The Spaghetti Origin Story</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <h4>
                For as long as I've been a person, Spaghetti has been my favorite food. There is no issue or doubt to this; it is just a fact of life. I love cooking it, I love smelling it, I love tasting it.
            My favorite thing is coming home and making a bit pot of Spaghetti, curling up, and watching Kiki's Delivery Service. But you're not here to learn about the nuances of my life. You're here
            to cook the world's best spaghetti. That's not my opinion. It's just a fact of life. Let's get to it.

        <h1>The ideas on how to prepare such things</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Wake up. Eons have passed. Unless I specifically mention otherwise, it's safe to assume you should stir things in when you add them.</li>
            <li>Throw the Olive oil into a Dutch Oven or some kind of big pot for Sauce. Crank up the heat, till the oil is sheeny, then follow.</li>
            <li>Throw the diced onion in there, let it turn yellow, then dump the garlic in.</li>
            <li>Once those are both fragrant and good, about 2 mins, add Tomato Paste. Mix it in.</li>
            <li>now add the wine, stir it in a bit. let it reduce (This means the wine should be less liquid, and more pulpy at the bottom of the pot)</li>
            <li>Once reduced sufficiently (not a pool, more like a puddle), add the crushed tomatos and base sauce. SPECIFICALLY do not stir the sauce. Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. 
                It'll burn the bottom with the garlic, onion, and paste, to the bottom of the pan. then, when you stir it, you will see little dark or ideally black bits mix around. this is good.
                This process infuses it with a lovely earthy taste that's unparalleled.
            </li>
            <li>dd seasonings and mix in once it's safe and burned, you can add them before and carefully only stir vertically, but that takes a lot of practice.</li>
            <li>Let it cook for as long as you can tolerate: at least 45 minutes, but the longer the better. If you're making the meat, this is a good time to cook it if you haven't prepped until now.</li>
        </ol>
